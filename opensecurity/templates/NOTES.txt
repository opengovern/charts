OpenSecurity has been deployed.

1.  **Access the UI:**

    To access the OpenSecurity UI, set up port forwarding to the nginx-proxy service. Open a separate terminal and run:

    kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-proxy 8080:80
    {{- /* Note: Ensure the service name '{{ .Release.Name }}-nginx-proxy' matches the actual service created by your chart. */}}

    Then, open your web browser and navigate to:

    http://localhost:8080

2.  **Login Credentials:**

    * **Username:** admin@clearcompass.so
    * **Password:** The initial admin password is stored in a Kubernetes Secret. To retrieve it, run the following command:

        kubectl get secret -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "opensecurity.fullname" . }}-initial-admin-password -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode

        (Note: The command prompt might show a '%' character after the password if there's no trailing newline; this is usually not part of the password itself.)

3.  **Documentation:**
